            <h1 style="font-size: 36px;">DUCATI</h1>
            <p  style="font-size:26px ;">Ducati, founded in Bologna in 1926 by the Ducati brothers, originally produced radio components before introducing its first motorbike engine, the iconic “Cucciolo,” in 1946  . Over the next decades, Ducati earned a reputation in racing, leveraging its revolutionary desmodromic valve system, first used in 1956 to enable higher-revving engines without valve float  .
            <br>
            By the 1970s, Ducati had adopted the 90° V-twin “L‑twin” engine, combining power, balance, and the signature growl that enthusiasts recognize  . The 1980s and 1990s saw Ducati dominate World Superbike, driven by models like the 851, 888, and the legendary 916—crowned one of the most beautiful and successful sportbikes ever  .
            <br>
            In 2012, Audi (via Volkswagen Group) acquired Ducati, providing increased global reach and improved production standards. This helped modern Ducati bikes become more reliable while retaining their Italian soul  . Today Ducati sells over 58,000 motorcycles worldwide annually (2023 data), with a dealer network spanning 90+ countries  .
            <br>
            Ducati's racing pedigree continues—four MotoGP constructors’ titles in five years and a dominant presence in World Superbike underscore its engineering excellence  . Yet it remains a brand rooted in motorcycle passion: its CEO describes Ducati as more entertainment than machine, appealing to those who ride for love, not just transport  .</p>
